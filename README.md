# ZPHS01B_AirQualitySensor
This library is used to get data from the air quality sensor ZPHS01B developped by Winsen. The library is designed to work with Arduino or ESP32 on PlatformIO. One can also use Arduino IDE, in this case you need to comment out <Arduino.h> from the example file.
When using ESP32 with PlatformIO, you need to download the EspSoftwareSerial library.
The datasheet of the sensor can be found [here](https://www.winsen-sensor.com/d/files/zphs01b-english-version1_1-20200713.pdf).
